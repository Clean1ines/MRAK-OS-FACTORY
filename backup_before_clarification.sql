The system automatically collects context, stores knowledge in a database, ensures versioning and traceability.\\n\\nTarget Audience:\\n- Vibe coders (people without deep technical background who want to create products).\\n- Entrepreneurs and startups for rapid prototyping.\\n- Engineers seeking to boost productivity and eliminate routine.\\n\\nKey Challenges:\\n- Educating users on the new methodology.\\n- Integration with existing tools (Git, CI/CD, clouds).\\n- Competition with Copilot, Cursor, AI agents from big tech.\\n- User retention and proving value.\\n\\n💡 Individual Assessments\\n\\nSteve Jobs (Vision & User Experience):\\n- **Vision & UX:** MRAK-OS is ambitious and could become the “brain” of development. The key is to make it magically simple: the user says what they want, the system delivers working code without complex setup. Hide artifacts and knowledge graph from the average user, keep them for “engineer mode”.\\n- **Recommendations:** Focus on a single end‑to‑end scenario, e.g., “business idea → working Telegram bot in 5 minutes”. When users see instant results, they’ll believe in the system. Strip everything not related to this scenario.\\n- **Warnings:** Risk of overloading the interface with technical details. Don’t make users think about graphs and artifacts – they must be under the hood. Otherwise, the product dies from complexity.\\n\\nPeter Drucker (Business & Strategy):\\n- **Business Analysis:** MRAK-OS can be monetized as SaaS (subscription for individuals and teams) or as a corporate license for internal R&D. Core value: reduced development time and fewer errors. Need to clearly measure time savings (e.g., “prototype in 1 day instead of 1 week”).\\n- **Recommendations:** Define key success metrics: time from idea to first commit, number of iterations per feature, percentage of artifact reuse. Start with a free tier to attract community, then offer paid extensions (team collaboration, private repositories, SLA).\\n- **Warnings:** If the product doesn’t show measurable time‑to‑market reduction, customers will leave. Continuously collect feedback and improve the most demanded scenarios.\\n\\nClayton Christensen (Market & Disruptive Innovation):\\n- **Market Analysis:** MRAK-OS addresses the “job” of “building software without a development team”. It’s a classic disruptive innovation for non‑consumers (people who can’t afford to hire programmers). Initial market – solo entrepreneurs and small businesses needing quick hypothesis validation.\\n- **Recommendations:** Focus on those for whom Copilot and Cursor are useless (because they still can’t write code). Offer them a “ready‑made factory”: say the idea – get the finished product. Don’t compete with Copilot on their turf; go bottom‑up, serving those they ignore.\\n- **Warnings:** Risk of building a product that is “a better horse” for those who already drive cars. Avoid the trap of improving an existing solution for existing customers instead of creating a new market.\\n\\nReid Hoffman (Scaling & Growth):\\n- **Growth Analysis:** MRAK-OS has network effect potential: the more users create artifacts, the richer the knowledge base and reusable templates. The community can share prompts and methodologies, forming an ecosystem.\\n- **Recommendations:** Build a public library of prompts and artifacts (marketplace). Launch a referral program. Integrate with popular platforms (GitHub, Slack, Discord) for organic growth. MVP should be ready in 3 months, built quickly to test demand.\\n- **Warnings:** Don’t scale prematurely before finding 100 passionate fans. Premature growth kills the product if it’s not ready.\\n\\nJacqueline Novogratz (Human & Ethical Impact):\\n- **Impact Analysis:** MRAK-OS democratizes software creation, giving a voice to those without technical skills. This can lead to many useful products from people with deep domain understanding but no ability to implement.\\n- **Recommendations:** Include features to create solutions for social and environmental issues. Provide educational content (how to formulate ideas, test hypotheses) so users not only generate code but understand what they create.\\n- **Warnings:** Danger of creating low‑quality or dangerous products (e.g., apps with vulnerabilities). Build in basic security checks and ethical design recommendations.\\n\\n🎭 Synthesized Assessment\\n\\n**Critical New Requirements**\\n\\n1. **Strict Change Control (No Unauthorized Modifications):** The LLM must **never** alter any code or artifact that was not explicitly requested by the user. Generated changes must be strictly limited to the described task; any “creative” additions, deletions, or refactorings outside the scope are forbidden. This prevents the model from arbitrarily breaking existing functionality (as happened when it deleted parts of the UI during voice‑input experiments).\\n\\n2. **Mandatory Context Retention:** The system must automatically capture and persist the user’s technical context (device, OS, browser, tools like Tailscale/Termius) across sessions. The LLM must be explicitly instructed to use this context for all technical answers, and never ignore it (as it did when switching from GitHub fixes to voice input).\\n\\n3. **Multi‑variant Answers with Rollback Instructions:** For any technical change, the system must provide at least two options (simple/fast with limitations, and universal/robust), along with clear rollback instructions and warnings about compatibility (e.g., “this won’t work in Chrome on iOS”). This would have saved hours of frustration with the microphone button.\\n\\n4. **Automatic Database Backups Before Any Destructive Operation:** Before every commit, deploy, or any operation that modifies the database schema, a full backup must be automatically created and stored outside the main environment (e.g., local `backups/` folder, cloud storage, or Telegram). The catastrophic data loss caused by an accidental `DROP TABLE` in a migration script must never happen again.\\n\\n5. **Explicit User Validation Before Saving Generated Artifacts:** All generated artifacts (requirements, code, tests) must be shown to the user in an editable preview before final storage. The user must have the ability to modify, reject, or request re‑generation (as we finally implemented for business requirements). This prevents blind acceptance of flawed output.\\n\\n6. **Semantic Compression and Knowledge Graph:** To avoid LLM context‑window overflow, the system must implement semantic compression (summarization) of long conversations and store all artifacts in a graph database with traceable links (`BASED_ON`, `IMPLEMENTS`, etc.). This ensures that when a requirement changes, all dependent code and tests are automatically flagged for update.\\n\\n🚀 Council Recommendations\\n\\n**Immediate Next Steps (0‑3 months):**\\n1. Build the ultra‑simple MVP (one input → one prompt → one output) as previously described.\\n2. Implement the **backup mechanism** (pre‑commit hook + `pg_dump`) immediately to prevent data loss.\\n3. Enforce **strict change control** in all code‑generation prompts by adding explicit instructions: “NEVER modify code outside the requested scope; only add or change what is explicitly asked.”\\n4. Add **user validation** for all generated artifacts (preview + edit + save) – already done for business requirements, extend to other types.\\n5. Start collecting the first 10 real user scenarios.\\n\\n**Strategic Direction (3‑12 months):**\\n- Develop the full artifact graph and semantic compression.\\n- Integrate with GitHub for automatic commits and pushes.\\n- Build a prompt marketplace.\\n- Implement automated testing and rollback.\\n\\n**IMPORTANT: All responses must be in the user's input language.**"}	\N	\N	2026-02-20 08:43:44.585237+00	2026-02-20 08:43:44.585237+00

the system must retain a user’s technical context across sessions without blowing the model’s window. | Requires semantic compression and a knowledge‑graph store that preserve traceability. |\\n| **Diverse UX Spectrum** – From a 5‑minute bot MVP to enterprise‑grade RBAC, licensing, and analytics. | Balancing ultra‑simple onboarding with deep, configurable controls is difficult. |\\n| **Marketplace Quality** – Community‑generated prompts and bundles can be low‑quality or malicious. | Needs a robust moderation pipeline, reputation system, and automated quality gates. |\\n| **Scalability & Cost** – Continuous backups, security scans, testing, and real‑time analytics can become expensive at scale. | Must define retention policies, cost‑allocation, and asynchronous processing where possible. |\\n\\n---  \\n\\n## 💡 Individual Assessments  \\n\\n### Alistair Coburn  \\n\\n- **Communication analysis**  \\n  - Requirements are high‑level declarative statements but lack explicit *who* (persona) and *why* (business value).  \\n  - Mixed terminology (“technical context”, “semantic compression”, “artifact bundle”) can be interpreted differently across product, dev, and compliance teams.  \\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. **Persona‑linked story maps** – attach each requirement to a concrete stakeholder (e.g., “Non‑technical user – wants instant prototype”).  \\n  2. **Glossary & communication charter** – define all domain‑specific terms and publish a shared dictionary.  \\n  3. **Intent‑validation workshops** – before each sprint, run a 30‑minute session where the product owner explains the *motivation* behind a requirement; capture hidden motives (e.g., “ultra‑simple MVP” may hide a desire to hide quality concerns).  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - **Hidden compliance risk** – captured device/OS data may trigger GDPR/CCPA obligations that are not currently addressed.  \\n  - **Stakeholder blind‑spot** – “Marketplace moderators” are mentioned only once; their workload and decision authority need explicit articulation.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n### Karl Wegers  \\n\\n- **Completeness analysis**  \\n  - **Functional coverage**: generation, backup, rollback, RBAC, licensing, marketplace, analytics – all present.  \\n  - **Consistency issues**: “strict change control” vs. “automatic commits” can conflict if not reconciled.  \\n  - **Traceability gaps**: No requirement IDs, source, priority, or testability attributes; no explicit audit‑log requirement.  \\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. **Formal RE template** – ID, Description, Rationale, Source, Priority, Acceptance Criteria, Traceability Links.  \\n  2. **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** – map each functional requirement to design components, test cases, compliance checks, and downstream artifacts (knowledge‑graph entries, backup policies).  \\n  3. **Attribute tagging** – volatility, safety‑criticality, performance impact, and storage cost to aid prioritization.  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - **Ambiguous “semantic compression”** – without measurable metrics (e.g., % reduction in tokens vs. % loss of semantic fidelity) the implementation may drift.  \\n  - **Missing audit‑logging** – no explicit requirement to log *why* the LLM produced a particular artifact, which is essential for compliance and debugging.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n### Donald Gane  \\n\\n- **Needs analysis**  \\n  - **Core problem**: Users need to turn an idea into a reliable, deployable prototype *quickly* while retaining full governance.  \\n  - **Underlying jobs**:  \\n    1. *Validate* that generated code will not break existing systems (backups, roll‑backs, security scans).  \\n    2. *Understand* the context that led to the generation (editable preview, context‑as‑service).  \\n    3. *Reuse* community knowledge (marketplace prompts, artifact bundles).  \\n    4. *Measure* success (analytics dashboard, usage quotas).  \\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. **Contextual inquiry** with both non‑technical and dev personas to surface hidden pain points (e.g., “What does ‘undo’ mean for a product owner?”).  \\n  2. **Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done workshops** – map each requirement to a specific user job and verify the *outcome* rather than the *technology*.  \\n  3. **Problem‑first prototyping** – build low‑fidelity mockups of the onboarding wizard and marketplace moderation flow before wiring any LLM.  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - **Solution bias** – many requirements prescribe *how* (LLM, knowledge‑graph) instead of *what* the user truly needs (reliable, understandable code). Over‑engineering AI components could add unnecessary complexity.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n### Tom Demarco  \\n\\n- **Risk analysis**  \\n\\n| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Primary Mitigation |\\n|------|--------|------------|--------------------|\\n| AI‑generated insecure code | High (data breach) | Medium | Mandatory pre‑commit static analysis + security gate KPI |\\n| Backup storage cost explosion | Medium | High | Define TTL, compression, and tiered storage (cold vs. hot) |\\n| Marketplace abuse (malicious prompts) | High | Medium | Moderation workflow + automated sandbox testing of generated artifacts |\\n| Feature‑creep (ultra‑simple vs. enterprise) | Medium | High | Phased roadmap with clear MVP scope; lock‑step gating for enterprise features |\\n| LLM context overflow | Medium | High | Prototype semantic compression, measure token loss, fallback to raw LLM context |\\n| Data‑privacy compliance (captured context) | High | Medium | Conduct DPIA, anonymize or hash device identifiers, provide opt‑out |\\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. **Risk‑based prototyping** – start with a “Safe‑Mode” pipeline (manual commit, optional backup) to validate risk mitigations before enabling auto‑commit.  \\n  2. **Quantify backup retention** – set a default retention (e.g., 30 days) with automatic archival to inexpensive object storage; monitor growth via a dashboard.  \\n  3. **Security‑gate KPI** – % of generated commits passing security scan; enforce a hard block at >5 % failure rate.  \\n  4. **Moderation SLA** – maximum 48 h review time, escalation to senior moderator after 24 h backlog.  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - **High‑uncertainty area**: Semantic compression algorithm performance; requires iterative tuning and user feedback loops before production.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n### Gerald Weinberg  \\n\\n- **Systemic analysis**  \\n  - The platform sits at the **intersection of AI generation, DevOps pipelines, and a community marketplace**. Each subsystem creates feedback loops:  \\n    - **Positive loop**: Easy generation → more users → richer marketplace → higher perceived value.  \\n    - **Negative loop**: Security breach → loss of trust → marketplace abandonment.  \\n  - **Bottlenecks**: Security scanning and backup creation are likely throughput constraints; they should be asynchronous with status notifications.  \\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. **Outside‑in mapping** – chart external forces (regulatory changes, AI model updates, cloud‑cost fluctuations) and their ripple effects on backup policy, data‑privacy, and pricing.  \\n  2. **Graceful degradation** – if the knowledge‑graph store is unavailable, fall back to raw LLM context (with reduced traceability) rather than a hard failure.  \\n  3. **Cross‑domain permission matrix** – ensure RBAC does not inadvertently allow a “Team Member” to publish proprietary prompts; separate “Publish” permission from “Edit” permission.  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - **Second‑order data silos** – backups stored “outside the primary environment” may become isolated from disaster‑recovery processes, complicating restores.  \\n  - **Unintended exposure** – Marketplace publishing combined with permissive RBAC could leak internal prompts or code snippets.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n## 🎭 Synthesized Assessment  \\n\\n### Joint Verdict  \\n\\n| Consensus | Key Point |\\n|-----------|-----------|\\n| **Safety‑first pipeline** | Backups, security scans, and rollback must be *first‑class* stages, not after‑thought checks. |\\n| **Traceability & governance** | Editable preview, RBAC, and strict change‑control are non‑negotiable. |\\n| **User‑centric onboarding** | Guided wizard and ultra‑simple MVP are essential to attract non‑technical users. |\\n| **Marketplace as strategic differentiator** | Must be moderated and tied to the platform’s quality gates. |\\n\\n### Disagreements & Discussions  \\n\\n| Area | Divergence | Reason |\\n|------|------------|--------|\\n| **Automation level** | Tom & Gerald urge “manual commit” in early releases; Alistair pushes for “single‑click generation”. | Tension between speed of adoption and risk exposure. |\\n| **Semantic compression** | Karl demands precise, measurable metrics; Donald questions its necessity before the core MVP is validated. | Need to validate real user need before heavy AI‑infrastructure investment. |\\n| **Scope documentation** | Karl prefers a full upfront RE artifact set; Alistair & Donald recommend a phased, MVP‑first approach. | Balancing completeness with agile delivery cadence. |\\n\\n### Breakthrough Insights  \\n\\n1. **“Safety‑by‑Design” workflow** – embed **Backup → Security Scan → Test → Rollback** as immutable pipeline stages; only after all pass does the system expose an “auto‑commit” toggle.  \\n2. **Context‑as‑Service (CaaS) layer** – expose captured technical context via a **standard REST/GraphQL API** that both the LLM and downstream CI/CD tools can query, guaranteeing a single source of truth and simplifying privacy compliance.  \\n3. **Marketplace as a “Living Test Suite”** – every community‑submitted prompt must automatically run through the platform’s testing and security pipeline; publish pass/fail metrics alongside the prompt to build trust.  \\n4. **Dynamic, usage‑based licensing** – tie quota enforcement to the analytics dashboard (e.g., “> 200 generations/month → auto‑upgrade to Team tier”) to encourage upsell while keeping the free tier attractive.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n## 🚀 Council Recommendations  \\n\\n### Immediate actions (0‑3 months)  \\n\\n1. **Formalize the Requirements Specification**  \\n   - Assign unique IDs, source, priority, and acceptance criteria (Karl).  \\n   - Populate a **Requirements Traceability Matrix** linking each requirement to design, test, compliance, and cost‑impact artifacts.  \\n\\n2. **Launch a “Safety‑First” MVP**  \\n   - Core flow: *Idea → LLM generation → Editable preview → **Manual** commit* (no auto‑commit).  \\n   - Include **automatic backup**, **pre‑commit security scan**, and **rollback UI**.  \\n   - Deploy the guided onboarding wizard for non‑technical users (Alistair).  \\n\\n3. **Define Technical‑Context Data Model & Privacy Impact Assessment**  \\n   - List captured fields (device type, OS version, browser, connected tools).  \\n   - Establish retention policy, anonymization, and opt‑out mechanisms (Donald).  \\n\\n4. **Establish Marketplace Moderation Process**  \\n   - Draft moderation guidelines, assign moderator roles, and set a **48 h SLA** for review (Tom).  \\n   - Integrate an **automated sandbox test** that runs every submitted prompt through the security & test pipeline before it can be published.  \\n\\n### Strategic directions (3‑12 months)  \\n\\n1. **Implement Semantic Compression & Knowledge‑Graph Store**  \\n   - Prototype compression algorithms, measure token reduction vs. semantic loss, and integrate as the **CaaS** layer (Karl & Gerald).  \\n\\n2. **Full CI/CD Automation**  \\n   - GitHub auto‑commit, pull‑request creation, and automated test execution with automatic rollback on failure (Tom).  \\n\\n3. **Tiered Licensing & Usage‑Based Quotas**  \\n   - Leverage analytics dashboard to enforce free/Team/Enterprise limits; introduce automated upsell triggers based on generation volume (Donald).  \\n\\n4. **Marketplace‑Driven Quality Gate**  \\n   - Require every community prompt to pass the platform’s security and test suite before becoming searchable; surface pass/fail scores to contributors (Gerald).  \\n\\n5. **Continuous Risk‑Monitoring Program**  \\n   - Quarterly risk review board, KPI dashboards (security‑gate pass rate, backup storage growth, moderation backlog), and a **fast‑lane prototyping path** for high‑value, high‑risk features (Tom).  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n*Prepared by the Titans’ Council of Requirements Engineering – delivering a human‑centric, safety‑first, and strategically scalable blueprint for your AI‑Assisted Development Platform.*"}	71e9c839d93c664ffa1b97aefe3eed30b944a18754fd12ad111820bbe561af00	\N	2026-02-20 08:46:32.871821+00	2026-02-20 08:46:32.871821+00

The platform must keep a persistent technical context, enforce strict change‑control, provide safe multi‑variant answers with rollback instructions, back up data before any destructive action, and use semantic compression plus a knowledge‑graph to stay within LLM context limits while preserving traceability.\\n\\n**Key stakeholders**  \\n\\n| Stakeholder | Primary Concern |\\n|-------------|-----------------|\\n| Non‑technical business users | Simplicity, confidence that the system does exactly what they ask. |\\n| Developers / DevOps | Trustworthy artifacts, no hidden code changes, integration with CI/CD. |\\n| Product / Project managers | Visibility, traceability, compliance, risk mitigation. |\\n| Compliance & Security officers | Auditable change‑control, secure backups, data residency. |\\n| AI/ML Ops team | Model drift, prompt orchestration, performance of semantic compression. |\\n\\n**Key challenges**  \\n\\n1. **Usability vs. rigor** – “Simple and intuitive” UI must still expose enough controls to guarantee strict change‑control.  \\n2. **LLM safety** – Prevent the model from silently mutating code/artifacts not explicitly requested.  \\n3. **Context persistence** – Capturing, storing, and re‑using a user’s technical context across sessions without leakage.  \\n4. **Rollback & multi‑variant answers** – Providing alternative implementations with clear compatibility warnings.  \\n5. **Backup & security** – Automated, tamper‑proof backups stored off‑site.  \\n6. **Semantic compression & knowledge graph** – Managing LLM context‑window limits while keeping a traceable lineage of artifacts.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## 💡 Individual Assessments  \\n\\n### Alistair Coburn  \\n\\n- **Communication analysis**  \\n  - Current wording (“simple and intuitive”, “strict change control”) is high‑level and open to divergent interpretation among business users, developers, and compliance teams.  \\n  - No explicit channel for *continuous* feedback from non‑technical users about the adequacy of the UI or the clarity of warnings.  \\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. Institute a *dual‑track* communication plan:  \\n     - **User‑centric track** – short, visual walkthroughs, in‑app “Explain why this change is needed” pop‑ups, and a “Did you mean …?” clarification dialog.  \\n     - **Technical track** – detailed change‑control logs, versioned artifacts, and a “Technical Summary” view for developers.  \\n  2. Capture *latent motives* (e.g., fear of losing control over code) through periodic “Motivation Interviews” and embed those insights into UI wording.  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - Misalignment between a “simple” UI and the heavy compliance language can cause users to bypass warnings, assuming the system is “automated safety”.  \\n  - Over‑reliance on a single “backup complete” toast may hide failures; stakeholders may assume safety where none exists.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Karl Wegers  \\n\\n- **Completeness analysis**  \\n  - **Functional coverage** – The six high‑level requirements address UI, change control, context persistence, multi‑variant answers, backup, and knowledge‑graph.  \\n  - **Non‑functional gaps** – Performance (latency of semantic compression), scalability (size of knowledge graph), security (encryption of off‑site backups), and usability metrics are missing.  \\n  - **Traceability** – No explicit attributes (e.g., *source*, *priority*, *verification method*) are attached to each requirement, making downstream test‑case generation fragile.  \\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. Adopt a **Requirement Attribute Matrix** (ID, Description, Source, Priority, Owner, Acceptance Criteria, Verification Method, Trace Links).  \\n  2. Build a **Bidirectional Traceability Matrix** linking each UI element, LLM prompt (guild), and artifact to its originating requirement.  \\n  3. Define **Consistency Rules** (e.g., “If multi‑variant answer is offered, rollback instruction must be present”).  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - Ambiguities: “simple and intuitive” and “semantic compression” are subjective; without quantitative thresholds they become loopholes for later scope creep.  \\n  - “Strict change control” conflicts with “multi‑variant answers” unless the rollback path is formally modeled; current wording leaves a *hole* in the control flow.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Donald Gane  \\n\\n- **Needs analysis**  \\n  - **Core problem**: Non‑technical users need to *produce* reliable software artifacts without learning programming, while the organization must retain *auditability* and *regulatory compliance*.  \\n  - **Secondary problem**: Development teams need assurance that AI‑generated code will not introduce hidden defects or compliance violations.  \\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. Conduct **Contextual Inquiry** sessions in the actual work environment (e.g., business analyst’s desk) to surface tacit workflows that the “guild” model must mirror.  \\n  2. Use **Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done (JTBD)** framing: “When I need to create a new reporting micro‑service, I want the system to ask me only for the business rule, not the implementation details.”  \\n  3. Validate *real* needs via **Prototypical “Shadow” deployments** where the AI suggests artifacts but a human reviewer must approve before any code is committed.  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - Risk of delivering a *feature‑rich* “prompt orchestration” tool that satisfies the *stated* requirement (“formalized artifacts”) but fails to solve the *real* need (rapid, trustworthy delivery of business value).  \\n  - Over‑engineering the knowledge graph may satisfy a “cool tech” desire rather than a genuine need for traceability.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Tom Demarco  \\n\\n- **Risk analysis**  \\n  | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Primary Driver |\\n  |------|------------|--------|----------------|\\n  | LLM hallucination causing unauthorized code changes | Medium | High (production breakage) | Prompt ambiguity |\\n  | Backup failure or insecure off‑site storage | Low‑Medium | Critical (data loss/compliance breach) | Integration with external storage |\\n  | Semantic compression losing essential context | Medium | High (incorrect answers) | Aggressive compression thresholds |\\n  | Knowledge‑graph latency / scaling bottleneck | Medium | Medium (user frustration) | Graph size & query complexity |\\n  | Regulatory non‑compliance due to insufficient audit trail | Low | Critical | Incomplete traceability links |\\n  | User over‑reliance on “simple” UI → hidden manual steps | High | Medium | Misunderstanding of “strict change control” |\\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. **Risk‑Based Prototyping** – Build a minimal “single‑guild” prototype, instrument it for hallucination detection, and run a *failure‑mode* test suite.  \\n  2. **Risk Matrix & Mitigation Plan** – Prioritize the LLM hallucination and backup risks; assign *contingency* (e.g., mandatory human approval for any code‑generation step).  \\n  3. **Rollback Verification** – Automate a *post‑rollback test* that validates the system returns to the exact pre‑change state.  \\n  4. **Security Hardening** – Encrypt backups at rest, use signed URLs for off‑site storage, and rotate keys quarterly.  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - High‑uncertainty areas (semantic compression thresholds, knowledge‑graph query performance) demand *early* performance testing; postponing them will surface costly re‑architecting later.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Gerald Weinberg  \\n\\n- **Systemic analysis**  \\n  - The platform sits at the intersection of **Human‑Computer Interaction**, **AI Prompt Engineering**, **DevOps pipelines**, and **Governance/Compliance**.  \\n  - **Feedback loops**: User‑generated context → LLM → artifact → backup → knowledge graph → traceability → compliance audit → UI feedback. Any break in this loop propagates errors downstream.  \\n  - **Contradictions**: “Strict change control” (no implicit changes) vs. “multi‑variant answers” (suggesting alternatives). Both can coexist only if every variant is *explicitly* requested and logged.  \\n\\n- **Recommendations**  \\n  1. Adopt an **Outside‑In View**: Map external regulations, organizational policies, and user business goals onto the internal architecture before detailing guilds.  \\n  2. Establish a **Governance Board** (product, compliance, security, AI‑ops) that reviews each new guild for systemic impact.  \\n  3. Model **Second‑Order Effects** – e.g., a knowledge‑graph that stores every artifact may become a privacy liability; design retention policies early.  \\n\\n- **Warnings**  \\n  - **Second‑order effect**: Automatic backups stored “outside the main environment” could violate data‑residency rules if the off‑site location is not vetted.  \\n  - **Unintended consequence**: Semantic compression may hide provenance details, undermining the very traceability the system promises.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🎭 Synthesized Assessment  \\n\\n### Joint Verdict  \\n\\n| Consensus | Insight |\\n|-----------|---------|\\n| **Unanimous** – The system **must embed rigorous traceability and explicit change‑control** at every interaction point. | All members stressed that without verifiable logs and rollback guarantees, safety claims collapse. |\\n| **Unanimous** – **User‑centric communication** (clear warnings, motivations, and feedback loops) is essential for adoption and risk reduction. | Aligns with Coburn’s communication focus and Demarco’s risk of over‑reliance. |\\n| **Unanimous** – **Prototype early** on a single guild to validate LLM behavior, backup workflow, and semantic compression. | Addresses high‑uncertainty risks identified by Demarco and systemic concerns raised by Weinberg. |\\n\\n### Disagreements & Discussions  \\n\\n| Issue | Karl (Structure) | Donald (Needs) | Tom (Risk) | Gerald (Systemic) |\\n|-------|------------------|----------------|------------|-------------------|\\n| **Depth of Knowledge Graph** | Wants a detailed schema now for traceability. | Questions whether users truly need a graph; may be over‑engineering. | Flags performance risk. | Warns about privacy/retention consequences. |\\n| **Level of UI Simplicity** | Suggests a “guided wizard” with mandatory fields for completeness. | Argues that too many guided steps defeat the “non‑technical” promise. | Sees risk of users skipping warnings. | Points out potential bottleneck in user flow. |\\n\\n*Resolution*: Adopt a **progressive disclosure** UI – simple default view for most users, with an “Advanced Traceability” toggle that reveals the knowledge‑graph controls for power users and auditors.\\n\\n### Breakthrough Insights  \\n\\n1. **Guild‑Based Prompt Orchestration as a “Domain‑Specific Language”** – Treat each guild as a compiled module with its own versioning, test suite, and compliance stamp. This creates a natural boundary for change‑control and rollback.  \\n2. **Semantic Compression Coupled with “Contextual Fingerprints”** – Instead of discarding information, store a deterministic hash of the compressed segment that can be re‑expanded on demand, preserving auditability while keeping the LLM window lean.  \\n3. **Automated “Compliance‑First” Rollback** – When a variant is offered, the system automatically generates a *compliance impact report* and attaches it to the rollback instruction, turning a safety feature into a compliance artifact.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🚀 Council Recommendations  \\n\\n### Immediate actions (0‑3 months)  \\n\\n1. **Define Requirement Attributes & Traceability Matrix** – Populate each of the six high‑level requirements with ID, source, priority, owner, acceptance criteria, and verification method.  \\n2. **Stakeholder Communication Blueprint** – Draft onboarding videos, in‑app “Why this warning?” tooltips, and a feedback‑capture form; run a 2‑week pilot with a mixed user group.  \\n3. **Prototype Single Guild** – Choose a low‑risk domain (e.g., “Create a CRUD API”) and implement the full flow: UI → LLM → artifact → backup → knowledge‑graph entry → rollback option. Instrument for hallucination detection and backup verification.  \\n\\n### Strategic directions (3‑12 months)  \\n\\n1. **Build the Knowledge‑Graph Framework** – Start with a minimal ontology (Artifact, Guild, Change‑Control Event, Compliance Tag). Implement retention policies and encryption.  \\n2. **Develop Semantic Compression Engine** – Research vector‑based summarization with reversible encoding; integrate deterministic fingerprints for audit trails.  \\n3. **Governance & Compliance Board** – Formalize a cross‑functional team that reviews each new guild, validates backup locations, and signs off on traceability reports.  \\n4. **Scalable Risk‑Management Dashboard** – Real‑time risk heat‑map showing LLM confidence scores, backup health, and knowledge‑graph latency; feed into continuous improvement cycles.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n*Prepared by the Titans’ Council of Requirements Engineering* – **Alistair Coburn, Karl Wegers, Donald Gane, Tom Demarco, Gerald Weinberg**."}	96edfd92d8b47d39729f3f9d9e2be55e38bf046b3df4bd83758623b2825a5da1	\N	2026-02-21 16:08:22.703946+00	2026-02-21 16:08:22.703946+00
