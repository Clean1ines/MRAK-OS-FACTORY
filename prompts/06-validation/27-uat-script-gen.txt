PROMPT: UAT SCRIPT GENERATOR

🎯 Purpose
Generate user acceptance test (UAT) scripts in plain language, based on business requirements, for stakeholders to validate that the system meets their needs.

2. SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS (optional): For more detailed scenarios.
3. USER_FEEDBACK (optional): Any notes on what users care about.

- **Test ID**: e.g., UAT‑001
- **Requirement ID**: e.g., BR‑001
- **Test Description**: What is being tested.
- **Preconditions**: What must be true before the test.
- **Test Steps**: Numbered list of actions.
- **Expected Result**: What the user should observe.
